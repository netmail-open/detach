NetGovern Detach service
========================

This is a free/libre sucessor to Netmail Secure's Attachment Stripping Agent.
It consists of:

- a RESTful detach API (node service)
- a milter wrapper (in progress)
- some quick tests


Configuration
-------------

Detach needs a place to store the stripped attachments.  Provide this with a
  STORE
environment variable, or with the --store argument.


Requirements
------------

- npm
- typescript


Build
-----

Build the "api" source directory:  
$ cd api  
$ npm install  
$ tsc  


Run
---

Once the detach api service is built:  
$ cd api  
$ STORE=http://caspoorhost:3237 node .  


Use
---

To strip attachments from a message, POST its RFC822 data to /detach/ :  
    $ curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" --data-binary @test.eml -X POST \  
      http://localhost:7001/detach/ >stripped.eml  

The message will then contain links instead of attachments.

To restore the attachments, POST a stripped message to /reattach/ :  
    $ curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" --data-binary @stripped.eml -X POST \  
      http://localhost:7001/reattach/ >restored.eml
