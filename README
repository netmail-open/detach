NetGovern Detach service
========================

This is a free/libre sucessor to Netmail Secure's Attachment Stripping Agent.
It consists of:

- a RESTful detach API (node service)
- a milter wrapper
- some quick tests


Configuration
-------------

Detach needs a place to store the stripped attachments.
(and maybe something to tell it a transformed url)


Requirements
------------

- npm
- typescript


Build
-----

Build the "api" source directory:
$ cd api
$ npm install
$ tsc

Optionally, build the milter:
$ cd milter
$ npm install
$ tsc


Run
---

Once the detach api service is built:
$ cd api
$ node .

optionally, run the milter:
$ cd milter
$ node .
